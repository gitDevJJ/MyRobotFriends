I did the whole project by myself (I couldn't find a partner).

The project is a web page that represents multiple Robot cards, each has some information about the robot.
Moreover, it has a search bar that helps find robots by using key words to minimize the results.

The project is created with React App:
Front-End uses Javascript, HTML and CSS.
Back-End uses the fetch() function to fetch some data from a web server.
